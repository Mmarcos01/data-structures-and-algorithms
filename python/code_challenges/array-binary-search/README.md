## Code Challenge 03: Binary search in a sorted 1D array

Write a function which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

| Input    |    Output |
| --- | --- |
| [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 15   |    2 |
| [-131, -82, 0, 27, 42, 68, 179], 42   |    4 |
| [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77], 90   |   -1 |
| [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], 4   |    -1 |
